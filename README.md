# Path
---

### Program to calculate the most probable pathway connecting two equilibrium states of a protein

It also computes the trajectory along the nth normal mode of a single stucture.

Download **_path.py_** and **_func.py_** to the same folder in your local computer and refer **_running-path_** for instructions on running the program

#### Dependencies

PATH is written in python and it relies on a few recipes that are a part of the NumPy, SciPy and Biopython libraries. Computers that use Python 2.6 or lower might also have to install argparse. The version of Python on your Unix/Linux machine can be checked using the following command

```python
python -V
```
You can download the libraries, that path depends on, from the following links
